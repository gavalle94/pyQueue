*** QUEUE STATS ***
Simulation ran from t0 = 0 to t1 = 100
At the moment, there are 0 clients in the system (0 in the queuing line)

Requests that have not reached the system:
- 0 (0.0 %) now
- 0 (0.0 %) in total
Received requests:
- 529 (100.0 %) now
- 529 (100.0 %) in total

-- LOCAL RESULTS --
About received requests:
- 414 have been accepted (78.26 %)
- 115 have been rejected (21.74 %)
=> 414 over 414 (100.0 %) accepted requests have been served correctly

Average number of clients into the queuing line: 3.76
Average number of clients into the server(s): 0.64
=> Average number of clients into the queue system: 4.4

Without considering the client requests still in the queuing line and/or into the server(s): 
- Mean value for the waiting time, into the queuing line: 0.91
- Mean value for the service time, into a server: 0.15 (only for served ones)
- Mean value for the traversing time, into the queue system: 1.06 (only for served ones)

*** SYSTEM STATS ***
Average number of customers into the system: 55.80
Average number of customers into the queuing lines: 54.18
Average number of customers into the servers: 1.62

Considering only served requests:
