*** QUEUE STATS ***
Simulation ran from t0 = 0 to t1 = 100
At the moment, there are 15 clients in the system (14 in the queuing line)

Requests that have not reached the system:
- 0 (0.0 %) now
- 0 (0.0 %) in total
Received requests:
- 1282 (100.0 %) now
- 1282 (100.0 %) in total

-- LOCAL RESULTS --
About received requests:
- 658 have been accepted (51.33 %)
- 624 have been rejected (48.67 %)
=> 643 over 658 (97.72 %) accepted requests have been served correctly

Average number of clients into the queuing line: 29.33
Average number of clients into the server(s): 0.98
=> Average number of clients into the queue system: 30.31

Without considering the client requests still in the queuing line and/or into the server(s): 
- Mean value for the waiting time, into the queuing line: 4.5
- Mean value for the service time, into a server: 0.15 (only for served ones)
- Mean value for the traversing time, into the queue system: 4.65 (only for served ones)
