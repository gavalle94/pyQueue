*** QUEUE STATS ***
Simulation ran from t0 = 0 to t1 = 100
At the moment, there are 11 clients in the system (10 in the queuing line)

Requests that have not reached the system:
- 0 (0.0 %) now
- 0 (0.0 %) in total
Received requests:
- 1630 (100.0 %) now
- 1630 (100.0 %) in total

-- LOCAL RESULTS --
About received requests:
- 685 have been accepted (42.02 %)
- 945 have been rejected (57.98 %)
=> 674 over 685 (98.39 %) accepted requests have been served correctly

Average number of clients into the queuing line: 6.43
Average number of clients into the server(s): 0.85
=> Average number of clients into the queue system: 7.28

Without considering the client requests still in the queuing line and/or into the server(s): 
- Mean value for the waiting time, into the queuing line: 0.93
- Mean value for the service time, into a server: 0.12 (only for served ones)
- Mean value for the traversing time, into the queue system: 1.06 (only for served ones)
