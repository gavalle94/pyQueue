*** QUEUE STATS ***
Simulation ran from t0 = 0 to t1 = 100
At the moment, there are 2 clients in the system (1 in the queuing line)

Requests that have not reached the system:
- 0 (0.0 %) now
- 0 (0.0 %) in total
Received requests:
- 501 (100.0 %) now
- 501 (100.0 %) in total

-- LOCAL RESULTS --
About received requests:
- 421 have been accepted (84.03 %)
- 80 have been rejected (15.97 %)
=> 419 over 421 (99.52 %) accepted requests have been served correctly

Average number of clients into the queuing line: 2.86
Average number of clients into the server(s): 0.59
=> Average number of clients into the queue system: 3.45

Without considering the client requests still in the queuing line and/or into the server(s): 
- Mean value for the waiting time, into the queuing line: 0.68
- Mean value for the service time, into a server: 0.14 (only for served ones)
- Mean value for the traversing time, into the queue system: 0.82 (only for served ones)

*** SYSTEM STATS ***
Average number of customers into the system: 15.38
Average number of customers into the queuing lines: 13.80
Average number of customers into the servers: 1.58

Considering only served requests:
