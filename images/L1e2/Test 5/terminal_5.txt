*** QUEUE STATS ***
Simulation ran from t0 = 0 to t1 = 100
At the moment, there are 1 clients in the system (0 in the queuing line)

Requests that have not reached the system:
- 0 (0.0 %) now
- 0 (0.0 %) in total
Received requests:
- 421 (100.0 %) now
- 421 (100.0 %) in total

-- LOCAL RESULTS --
About received requests:
- 349 have been accepted (82.9 %)
- 72 have been rejected (17.1 %)
=> 348 over 349 (99.71 %) accepted requests have been served correctly

Average number of clients into the queuing line: 3.12
Average number of clients into the server(s): 0.53
=> Average number of clients into the queue system: 3.65

Without considering the client requests still in the queuing line and/or into the server(s): 
- Mean value for the waiting time, into the queuing line: 0.89
- Mean value for the service time, into a server: 0.15 (only for served ones)
- Mean value for the traversing time, into the queue system: 1.05 (only for served ones)
